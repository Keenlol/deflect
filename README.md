# 🗡️ Deflect

**A 2D action survival game where defense is your only offense.**  
By Chetphisuth Tongpa (ID: 6710545491)

## 🎮 Game Overview

_Deflect_ is a fast-paced 2D side-scrolling survival game where players can't directly attack — instead, they must **deflect** enemy attacks to damage them. Inspired by Genji from Overwatch, players must time their defenses to survive increasingly difficult enemy waves.

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics

- **Side-scrolling movement**: Move left/right and jump like a Mario-style platformer.
- **Double Jump & Dash**: Perform agile maneuvers to avoid attacks.
- **Deflection System**: Use precise timing to reflect projectiles and melee attacks back at enemies.
- **Endless Loop Gameplay**: Survive as long as possible.

## 🕹️ Controls

| Action        | Key/Mouse         |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Move Left     | `A`               |
| Move Right    | `D`               |
| Jump / Double Jump | `W` or `SPACE` |
| Dodge (Dash)  | `SHIFT`           |
| Deflect       | `Left Mouse Click`|

## 🔧 Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the game locally:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
    *   Ensure you have `pip` (Python's package installer) available. It usually comes with Python.
    *   Note that the game is developed **on Windows**, so macOS users can potentailly have some side effects.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Clone the project repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory-name>
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install the required Python libraries using pip and the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Game:**
    Execute the main game script:
    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```

The game window should now open and you can start playing.
