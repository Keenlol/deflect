## 🎮 Game Overview

_Deflect_ is a fast-paced 2D side-scrolling survival game where players can't directly attack — instead, they must **deflect** enemy attacks to damage them. Inspired by Genji from Overwatch, players must time their defenses to survive increasingly difficult enemy waves.

## 🕹️ Core Mechanics

- **Side-scrolling movement**: Move left/right and jump like a Mario-style platformer.
- **Double Jump & Dash**: Perform agile maneuvers to avoid attacks.
- **Deflection System**: Use precise timing to reflect projectiles and melee attacks back at enemies.
- **Endless Loop Gameplay**: Survive as long as possible.

## 🎯 Controls

| Action        | Key/Mouse         |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Move Left     | `A`               |
| Move Right    | `D`               |
| Jump / Double Jump | `W` or `SPACE` |
| Dodge (Dash)  | `SHIFT`           |
| Deflect       | `Left Mouse Click`|

## 🛠️ Development

- Built using **Python + Pygame**.
- Uses **OOP** principles (Player, Enemies, Projectiles, UI, etc.).
- Event-driven input system & rule-based mechanics.
